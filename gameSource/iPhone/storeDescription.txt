A captivating tile-clearing puzzle game by world-renowned independent designer Jason Rohrer.


If you find the crowd of copycat match-3 games to be mindless and boring...

If you think Tetris is interesting, even though it is over 20 years old...

If you're looking for an elegant, deep puzzle game that's completely fresh...


Then you should take a look at Primrose, which you can test for free (full version) on Mac, Windows, and GNU/Linux here:  http://primrose.sf.net


Primrose's gameplay is deceptively simple:  You're given randomly chosen pairs of colored tiles that you must place on a 7x7 grid.  Surround a group of tiles with another color to remove the group.  The surrounding tiles flip to the color of the group that was removed.  When tiles flip color, chain reactions are possible.  Larger groups cleared and longer chain reactions are awarded more points.

As the game progresses, more colors are added to the pool, making the grid more and more constrained.  Pressure builds until the grid finally fills up, and the game ends.

Despite this mounting pressure, the game doesn't have a frantic feel, because you have as much time as you want to make each move.  Whereas Tetris depends on getting faster and faster to be challenging, Primrose derives deep challenge from inherent properties of its mechanics.


Primrose includes the following features:

--Live, networked high score boards.  Compete against the world right from your iPhone, wherever you are.

--Instant replay, move-by-move, of all games on the high score boards.  Wondering how other players got those unbelievable scores?  Just touch Play and watch how they did it.

--Comprehensive instruction pages with realtime, animated examples.

--Glowing, pulsating, retro graphics and analog synth inspired sound effects.

--Behaves like a proper iPhone app by auto-saving game progress during calls and other interruptions.  Take the call, then resume right where you left off after the call ends.  

--Colorblind mode available.
