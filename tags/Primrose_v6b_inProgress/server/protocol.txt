All returns are whitespace-delimited.

Error returns start with the string "ERROR:"




=== Call:
server.php?action=fetch_scores

Returns:
numAllTimeScores
scoreBundle0
scoreBundle1
...
scoreBundleN
numTodayScores
scoreBundle0
scoreBundle1
...
scoreBundleM


Where:
scoreBundle = name#score#seed#seed_history#move_history

Note:
--seed is the starting random seed as an ASCII-encoded base-10 unsigned int.

--seed_history contains any new seeds that were adopted throughout the game
  (after saved-game reloads).  Seed history is encoded as MOVE_NUMBER SEED
  pairs, where MOVE_NUMBER is the move AFTER which the new seed was set
  and SEED is the new seed as an unsigned int.  The components of the pairs 
  are separated by "_", and "__" (double-underscore) occurs between pairs.
  Example:   82_3482793489__143_789498739__190_234987987
             New seeds were set in this game after move 82, 143, and 190.

--seed_history can be empty.

--move_history is a sequence of base-49 digits (digits 0-48 of base-64 
  encoding, each representing one of the 49 possible move locations).



=== Call (params probably in POST body):
server.php?action=post_score&name=[name]&score=[score]&seed=[seed]&move_history=[move_history_string]&hash=[hash_string]

Returns: 
Same as fetch_scores above


Where:
hash_string = sha1( concat( name, score, seed, seed_history, 
                            move_history, secureSalt ) )

secureSalt is a secret string shared by both client and server
